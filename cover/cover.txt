THE NATURE OF CODE

How can we capture the unpredictable evolutionary and emergent properties of nature in software?

How can understanding the mathematical principles behind our physical world help us to create digital worlds?

This book focuses on a range of programming strategies and techniques behind computer simulations of natural systems, from basic concepts in mathematics and physics to Processing libraries that enable sophisticated visual results.

Subjects covered include forces, trigonometry, fractals, cellular automata, self-organization, and genetic algorithms.
