=== 4.2 A Single Particle

The second function directs the Walker object to take a step.   Now, this is where things get a bit more interesting.   Remember that floor on which we were taking random steps?  Well, now we can use a Processing window in that same capacity.  There are four possible steps—a step to the right can be simulated by incrementing [var]*x* ([var]*x*++++); to the left by decrementing [var]*x* ([var]*x--*); forward by going down a pixel ([var]*y++*); and backward by going up a pixel ([var]*y--*).   How do we pick from these four choices?   Earlier we stated that we could flip two coins.  In Processing, however, when we want to randomly choose from a list of options, we can pick a random number using [var]*random()*.

=== 5.8  Fixed Box2D Objects

In the example we just created, the Box objects appear at the mouse location and fall downwards due to Box2D’s default gravity force.  What if we wanted to install some immovable boundaries in the Box2D world that would block the path of the Box objects (as in the illustration below)?

Box2D makes this easy for us by providing a means to lock a Body (and any associated Shapes) in place.   Just set the BodyDef type to STATIC.

==============================
Using PolygonShape, create your own Polygon design (remember, it must be concave).  Some possibilities below.

==============================


A polygon shape will get us pretty far in Box2D.  Nevertheless, the convex shape requirement will severely limit the range of possibilities.  The good news is that we can completely eliminate this limit by creating a single Box2D body out of multiple shapes!  Let’s return to our little alien creature and simplify the shape to be a thin rectangle with a circle on top.  

How can we build a single Body with two Shapes?  Let’s first review how we built a single Body with one Shape.

_Step 1:  Define the Body._ + 
_Step 2: Create the Body._ + 
*_Step 3: Define the Shape._* + 
*_Step 4: Attach the Shape to the Body._* + 
_Step 5: Finalize the Body’s mass._

Attaching more than one Shape to a Body is as simple as repeating steps 3 and 4 over and over again.
