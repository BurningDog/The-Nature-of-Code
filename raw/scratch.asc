The Nature of Code
==================


include::chapters/mathsvgfiles.asc[]


In Chapters 1 through 4, all of the examples will be written from “scratch”—meaning the code for the algorithms driving the motion of the objects will be written directly in Processing.   We’re certainly not the first programmers ever to consider the idea of simulating physics in animation, so next we’ll examine how physics libraries (*Chapter 5*) can be used to model more advanced and sophisticated behaviors.  We’ll look at http://www.box2d.org[Box2D] and http://toxiclibs.org/[toxiclibs' Verlet Physics package].
