The Nature of Code
==================

OK. We know that the definition of tangent is:

{tangentvelocityfrac}

The problem with the above is that we know velocity, but we donâ€™t know the angle.  We have to solve for the angle.   This is where a special function known as _inverse tangent_ comes in, sometimes referred to as _arctangent_ or _tan^-1^_.  (There is also an _inverse sine_ and an _inverse cosine_.)  

If the tangent of some value [var]*a* equals some value [var]*b*, then the inverse tangent of [var]*b* equals [var]*a*. For example:

_if_::     _tangent(a) = b_
_then_::   _a = arctangent(b)_

See how that is the inverse?   The above now allows us to solve for the angle:

_if_::  _tangent(angle) = velocity~x~ / velocity~y~_
_then_::  _angle = arctangent(velocity~x~ / velocity~y~)_
