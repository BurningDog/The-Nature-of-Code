=== 4.2 A Single Particle

Before we can get rolling on the system itself, we’ve got to work on writing the class to describe a single particle.  The good news: we’ve done this already.    Our [klass]*Mover* class from Chapter 2 serves as the perfect template.  For us, a particle is an independent body that moves about the screen.  It has [var]*location*, [var]*velocity*, and [var]*acceleration*, a constructor to initialize those variables, and functions to [function]*display()* itself and [function]*update()* its location.
