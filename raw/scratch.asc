=== 4.2 A Single Particle

The second function directs the Walker object to take a step.   Now, this is where things get a bit more interesting.   Remember that floor on which we were taking random steps?  Well, now we can use a Processing window in that same capacity.  There are four possible steps—a step to the right can be simulated by incrementing [var]*x* ([var]*x*++++); to the left by decrementing [var]*x* ([var]*x--*); forward by going down a pixel ([var]*y++*); and backward by going up a pixel ([var]*y--*).   How do we pick from these four choices?   Earlier we stated that we could flip two coins.  In Processing, however, when we want to randomly choose from a list of options, we can pick a random number using [var]*random()*.

[formula]*Alphabet: A*  + 
[formula]*Axiom:  A* + 
[formula]*Rules:  (A +++&#8594;+++ ABA)  (B — > BBB)*

To read a sentence, we’ll translate it in the following way:

[formula]*A:  Draw a line forward.* + 
[formula]*B:  Move forward without drawing.*

Let’s look at the sentence of each generation and its visual output.

[formula]*Generation 0: A* + 
[formula]*Generation 1: ABA* + 
[formula]*Generation 2: ABABBBABA* + 
[formula]*Generation 3: ABABBBABABBBBBBBBBABABBBABA*
