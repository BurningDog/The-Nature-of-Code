The second function directs the Walker object to take a step.   Now, this is where things get a bit more interesting.   Remember that floor on which we were taking random steps?  Well, now we can use a Processing window in that same capacity.  There are four possible steps—a step to the right can be simulated by incrementing [var]*x* ([var]*x*++++); to the left by decrementing [var]*x* ([var]*x--*); forward by going down a pixel ([var]*y++*); and backward by going up a pixel ([var]*y--*).   How do we pick from these four choices?   Earlier we stated that we could flip two coins.  In Processing, however, when we want to randomly choose from a list of options, we can pick a random number using [var]*random()*.

Is that right?  It sounds good, but it’s not.  What’s missing?  In the case of seek, we said “Seek [var]*mouseX* and [var]*mouseY*.”  In the case of separate, we’re saying “separate from _everyone else_.”  Who is everyone else?  It’s the list of all the other vehicles.
