This last [function]*for* loop looks pretty similar to our code that looped through a regular array by accessing each index.  We initialize a variable called [var]*i* to 0 and count up by 1, accessing each element of the [klass]*ArrayList* until we get to the end. However, this is a nice moment to mention the “enhanced [function]*for* loop” available in Java (and Processing) which is a bit more concise. The enhanced loop works with both [klass]*ArrayList*++s++ and regular arrays and looks like this:

((("for loops","enhanced")))

for (Particle p: particles) {
  p.run();
