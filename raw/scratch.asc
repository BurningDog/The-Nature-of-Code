“Pathological monsters! cried the terrified mathematician<br/>
Every one of them a splinter in my eye<br/>
I hate the Peano Space and the Koch Curve<br/> 
I fear the Cantor Ternary Set<br/>
The Sierpinski Gasket makes me wanna cry<br/>
And a million miles away a butterfly flapped its wings<br/>
On a cold November day a man named Benoit Mandelbrot was born<br/>
