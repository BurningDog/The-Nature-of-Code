Since you can’t write static functions yourself in Processing, you might not have encountered them before.  [klass]*PVector*'s static functions allow us to perform generic mathematical operations on [klass]*PVector* objects without having to adjust the value of one of the input [klass]*PVector*++s++.  Let’s look at how we might write the static version of [function]*add()*:
