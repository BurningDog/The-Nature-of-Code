=== 4.1 Why We Need Particle Systems

“A particle system is a collection of many many minute particles that together represent a fuzzy object. Over a period of time, particles are generated into a system, move and change from within the system, and die from the system.”

“1. There should be no initial pattern for which there is a simple proof that the population can grow without limit. 2. There should be initial patterns that apparently do grow without limit. 3. There should be simple initial patterns that grow and change for a considerable period of time before coming to an end in three possible ways: fading away completely (from overcrowding or becoming too sparse), settling into a stable configuration that remains unchanged thereafter, or entering an oscillating phase in which they repeat an endless cycle of two or more periods.”

=== 6.5 Your Own Desires: Desired Velocity

The first two examples we’ve covered—seek and arrive—boil down to calculating a single vector for each behavior: the _desired_ velocity.  And in fact, every single one of Reynolds’s steering behaviors follows this same pattern.  In this chapter, we’re going to walk through several more of Reynolds’s behaviors—flow field, path-following, flocking.  First, however, I want to emphasize again that these are _examples_+++—+++demonstrations of common steering behaviors that are useful in procedural animation.   They are not the be-all and end-all of what _you_ can do.  As long as you can come up with a vector that describes a vehicle’s _desired_ velocity, then you have created your own steering behavior.

“Wandering is a type of random steering which has some long term order: the steering direction on one frame is related to the steering direction on the next frame. This produces more interesting motion than, for example, simply generating a random steering direction each frame.”
