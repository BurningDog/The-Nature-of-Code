|3. A function in the [klass]*Mover* class that receives an [klass]*Attractor*:  |m.attractedTo(a);
|4. A function in the [klass]*Attractor* class that receives a [klass]*Mover* and returns a [klass]*PVector*, which is the attraction force.  That attraction force is then passed into the [klass]*Mover's* [function]*applyForce()* function:  |PVector f = a.attract(m);
m.applyForce(f);
