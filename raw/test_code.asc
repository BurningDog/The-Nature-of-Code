In 1982, William T. Reeves, a researcher at Lucasfilm Ltd., was working on the film “Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.”   Much of the movie revolves around the Genesis Device, a torpedo that when shot at a barren, lifeless planet has the ability to reorganize matter and create a habitable world for colonization. During the sequence, a wall of fire ripples over the planet while it is being “terraformed.”   The term “particle system,” an incredibly common and useful technique in computer graphics, was coined in the creation of this particular effect.
