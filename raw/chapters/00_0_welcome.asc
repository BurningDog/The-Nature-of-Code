Hello everyone.

Welcome to The Nature of Code web site.   

*At the moment, this is still a draft!*

I am working on final edits as well as fixing up design elements.  If you notice anything amiss, there is still time to get changes in before the print version comes out!  Please submit corrections to the book http://github.com/shiffman/The-Nature-of-Code/issues[on my Nature of Code GitHub repo].  Bug reports for the site and online purchasing system can be reported on http://github.com/shiffman/natureofcode.com/issues[GitHub] as well.

The entire text of this book is available online for free as HTML, licensed under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported License</a>.

If you like this book, please consider *supporting it by http://natureofcode.com[purchasing the PDF]* or the print version (which I hope will be available by December.)

Thanks everyone!
