== Testing some Code

HI

[source,java]

<<<<<<< HEAD
int total = 10;

//[offset-down] Have you ever seen this syntax before? This is a new feature in Java 1.6 that Processing now supports. It allows us to specify in advance what type of object we intend to put in the ArrayList.
ArrayList<Particle> plist = new ArrayList<Particle>();
void setup() {
  for (int i = 0; i < total; i++) {
    // An object is added to an ArrayList with add().
    plist.add(new Particle());
  }
}
=======
particles[i] = 10; //[bold]
particles[i] = 10; // [bold]

// A comment
int y = 0;
